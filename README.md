# Javascript Peer Challenge 2
Welcome to your second peer challenge!
In this assignment, you and your pair will need to create some people!
To do so, you will need to create an Object, that takes in constructor arguments, at least 4.
Ensure that you capture the arguments as Object Properties.

Now that you have done that, create object functionality that manipulates the 4 values.
Then create additional functionality that logs each of the properties in a meaningful way.

Now use that object and create 20 people. 
Then call both sets of functionality built into the object for all 20 people.

## Hard Mode
Execute each of the 2 functionality sets in one line of code (hint: you will need a loop).

## Pro Mode
Write all of the results to the DOM and style them in a meaningful way.
